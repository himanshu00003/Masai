# Product Search & Filter

## ✅ Features:
- **Search Products:** Enter a keyword to filter products by title.  
- **Filter by Category:** Dynamically retrieves categories and filters products.  
- **Sort by Price:** Arrange products in ascending or descending order by price.

## 🔧 Fixes & Enhancements:
1. **Dynamically fetched categories** from the API.  
2. **Implemented search functionality** for filtering products by title.  
3. **Added price sorting** (low to high & high to low).  
4. **Displayed product count** reflecting current filters.  
5. **Used try-catch for error handling** to manage API request failures.  

## 🚀 How It Works:
1. On page load, products and categories are fetched from the API.  
2. Users can:  
   - **Search by title** (real-time filtering).  
   - **Filter by category** (dropdown selection).  
   - **Sort products** by price.  
3. The interface updates dynamically based on user interactions.  

## 🛠 Technologies Utilized:
- **HTML** – Defines the webpage structure.  
- **CSS** – Styles the layout and appearance.  
- **JavaScript** – Uses Fetch API, Async/Await, and filtering logic.

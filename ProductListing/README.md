# Product Listing with Error Handling

## Features:
✅ Retrieves product data from FakeStoreAPI.  
✅ Displays products in a **grid layout** with images, titles, and prices.  
✅ Includes a **"View Details" button** for each product (alerts product details).  
✅ Implements **error handling** to display a message if data retrieval fails.  

## How It Works:
1. The page loads and executes the `fetchProducts()` function.  
2. This function requests product data from **FakeStoreAPI**.  
3. If successful, the products appear in a **responsive grid format**.  
4. If an error occurs, an **error message** is displayed to the user.  

## Technologies Utilized:
- **HTML** – Structures the webpage.  
- **CSS** – Styles the interface and layout.  
- **JavaScript** – Uses Fetch API, Async/Await, and error handling for functionality.

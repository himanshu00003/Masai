# Create a New Post

## Features:
✅ Users can input a title and content for a new post.  
✅ Sends the post data as a JSON object to the JSONPlaceholder API.  
✅ Displays the API response, including the generated post ID.  
✅ Ensures input fields are validated before submission.  

## How It Works:
1. The form collects user input.
2. Upon submission, a `POST` request is sent to the API.
3. The response (post ID, title, and content) is displayed on the page.  

## Technologies Utilized:
- **HTML** – Defines the page structure.  
- **CSS** – Enhances styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** – Uses Fetch API, DOM manipulation, and form validation for interactivity.
